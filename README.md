AES
===

Python implementation of AES in the most straight-forward way I could see. This is pulled directly from the NIST standard. This was written for my personal education and I would not suggest using this in any kind of sensitive environment. Other than the obvious side-channel attacks, I can't realy guarantee it works other then the fact it passes the test vectors supplied! 

Feel free to take or edit this code in any way you fancy.
